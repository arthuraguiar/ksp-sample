# Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) Sample Project
Sample annotation processor created with Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) API. The repository supplements a blog post ["So, how do I write a Kotlin Symbol Processor (KSP)?"](https://proandroiddev.com/so-how-do-i-write-a-kotlin-symbol-processor-ksp-b9606e9e3818) featured on ProAndroidDev.com.

There are 2 working directories in this repository:
- **completed** - contains the completed project with the KSP annotation processor that is ready to run. Open `main-project/.../Main.kt` and run the `main` function to see the code generation in action.
- **start** - contains the minimum project configuration to start writing a custom _Kotlin symbol processor_.
